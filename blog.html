                    “Hi, I just started Diablo and I am struggling to beat the first boss to advance.” 
                    
                    
                    Overall, boss fights are focused on player skill rather than raw damage per second and damage control, so players need to put all their effort into fighting unless, of course, they are way too overpowered for that boss and difficulty. All bosses in Diablo count as Super Unique Monsters, also known as Elites.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    “Hi, I am wondering if I should get Diablo?”
                    
                    
                    Diablo is an action role-playing video game. The player moves and interacts with the environment primarily by way of a mouse. Other actions, such as casting a spell are performed in response to keyboard inputs. The player can acquire items, learn spells, defeat enemies, and interact with NPCs throughout the game.</b1>
